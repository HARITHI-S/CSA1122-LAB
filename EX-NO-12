1.2 ​PROJECTANALYSISANDPROJECTPLANNING
The initial requirements to develop the project about the mechanism of theForeign Trading System is bought from the trader. The requirements are analyzed and refined which enables the analyst (administrator) to efficiently use the Foreign Trading System. The complete project analysis is developed after the whole project analysis explainingaboutthescopeandthe project statement is prepared.
1.3 ​PROJECTDESCRIPTION:
This software is designed to maintain the details about the trading system thatexists between the foreign countries. These details are hold by the trading management system. The details to the system are provided by the customer and the supplier.

USE CASEDIAGRAM:
This diagram will contain the actors, use cases which are givenbelow
Actors:Customer,Supplier,Customofficer
Usecase:Orderofproduct,Quantity,Specifytheamount

CLASSDIAGRAM:
This diagram consists of the following classes, attributes and theiroperations.

ACTIVITYDIAGRAM:
This diagram will have the activities as Startpoint,Endpoint,Decision boxes as given below:
Activities: Order of the product, Specify amount, Payment, Moneytransfer
Decision box:Check foravailability

SEQUENCEDIAGRAM:
This diagram consists of the objects, messages and returnmessages.
Object:Customer,Supplier,Tradingmanagementsystem

COLLABORATIONDIAGRAM:
This diagram contains the objects and actors. This will be obtained bythecompletionof the sequence diagram and pressing the F5 key.

STATECHARTDIAGRAM:
It is a technique to describe thebehaviorofthesystem.Itdescribesallthepossiblestates that a particular object gets into the object oriented technique. State diagram are drawn for a single class to show to the lifetime behaviour of a single objects

COMPONENTDIAGRAM:
Thecomponent diagram is represented by figure dependency and it is a graph ofdesign of figure dependency. The component diagram's main purpose is to show the structural relationships between the components of a systems. It is represented by boxed figure. Dependencies are represented by communication association.

DEPLOYMENTDIAGRAM:
A deployment diagram in the unified modeling language serves to model thephysical deployment of artifacts on deployment targets. Deployment diagrams show "the allocation of artifacts to nodes according to the Deployments defined between them. It is represented by 3- dimentional box. Dependencies are represented by communication association

PACKAGEDIAGRAM:
A package diagram in unified modeling language that depicts the dependencies between the packages that make up a model. A Package Diagram (PD) shows a grouping of elements in the OO model, and is a Cradle extension to UML. PDs can be used toshowgroupsof classes in ClassDiagrams(CDs),groupsofcomponentsorprocessesinComponentDiagrams (CPDs), or groups of processors in Deployment Diagrams (DPDs).

RESULT:
Thus the diagrams [Usecase, Activity, Sequence, Collaboration, Class,Statechart, Component, Deployment, package ] for foreign trading system has beendesigned,executedand output is verified.
