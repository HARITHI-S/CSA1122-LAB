USECASE DIAGRAM:
This diagram will contain the actors, usecases whichare:
ACTORS:Employee,HR,CentralSystem
USECASE:	Nameandaddress,qualification,experience,internet,loan,verification

CLASS DIAGRAM:
This diagram consists of the following classes, attributes and theiroperations.

CLASSES
Central ManagementSystem
Employee1
HR
ATTRIBUTES
Employeename
Employeenumber
Employeedetails
Checkdetails
OPERATIONS
Tax()
Loan()
Leavetaken()
Loss ofpay()

ACTIVITY DIAGRAM:
This diagram will have the activities as start point, end point, decision boxesas:
ACTIVITIES:Enter the option to check, enter the salary, enter theworkingdays,leave taken, loss of pay
DECISION BOX:Option tocheck

SEQUENCE DIAGRAM:
This diagram consists of the objects, messages and returnmessages
OBJECT:Employee,HR,CentralSystem

COLLABORATION DIAGRAM:
This diagram contains the object sandactors.This will be obtained by the completing of the sequence diagram and pressing the F5 key

STATECHART DIAGRAM:
It is a technique to describe thebehaviorofthesystem.Itdescribesallthepossiblestates that a particular object gets into the object oriented technique. State diagram are drawn for a single class to show to the lifetime behaviour of a single objects.

COMPONENT DIAGRAM:
The component diagram is represented by figure dependency and it is a graph ofdesign of figure dependency. The component diagram's main purpose is to show the structural relationships between the components of a systems. It is represented by boxed figure. Dependencies are represented by communication association

DEPLOYMENT DIAGRAM:
A deployment diagram in the unified modeling language serves to modelthe physical deployment of artifacts on deployment targets. Deployment diagrams show "the allocation of artifacts to nodes according to the Deployments defined between them. It is represented by 3- dimentional box. Dependencies are represented by communication association.

PACKAGE DIAGRAM:
A package diagram in unified modeling language that depicts the dependencies between the packages that make up a model. A Package Diagram (PD) shows a grouping of elements in the OO model, and is a Cradle extension to UML. PDs can be used toshowgroupsof classes in ClassDiagrams(CDs),groupsofcomponentsorprocessesinComponentDiagrams (CPDs), or groups of processors in Deployment Diagrams (DPDs).
There are three types of layer.They are
    • User interfacelayer
    • Domain layer
    • Technical services layer


PROGRAM CODING:
EMPLOYEE:
Public class employee
{
Public integer employeedetails; Public integer salary;
Public void leavetaken()
{
}
Public voidemployee()
{
}
}
HUMANRE SOURCES:
Public classHR
{
Public integer checkdetails; Public void loss of pay()
{
}
Public voidtax()
{
}
Public voidHR()
{
}
}
CENTRAL MANAGEMENTSYSTEM:
Public class central managementsystem
{
Public integer employeename; Public integer employee no;
Public integerdetails;
Public void leavetaken()
{
}
Public voidtax()
{
}
Public voidloan()
{
}
Public voidsalary()
{
}
}

RESULT:
Thus the diagram [ usecase, class, activity, sequence, collaboration, state chart,component, deployment, package] for the Software Personnel Management System has been designed, executed and output is verified.
